This theme is kinda in need of a lot of improvement, but using it to make a site revealed a lot to me about how astro works. 
Inline styles everywhere. I don't like it, and I plan to swap it out with another soon. Maybe I'll make this my project to
convert the theme to a more elegant implementation. Idk. I'm disappointed I chose this one. Oh well, live and learn.
